# Card drinking game
## Explanation:

<p>The drinking game uses a Skat card deck, where each player draws a card one after another. Each card value, such as Jack, Ace, or Ten, is associated with a specific action. <br>These actions can also be customized. The player who's turn it is must perform the action associated with the card drawn. The game ends once the **fourth King** has been drawn.</p>
